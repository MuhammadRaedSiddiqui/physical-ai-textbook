# Week 8 - NVIDIA Isaac Sim & SDK

## 1. Introduction to Isaac Sim
NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a robotics simulation toolkit built on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform. It offers photo-realistic rendering and physically accurate simulation, making it ideal for training and testing AI-based robots.

**Hardware Requirement:** Due to its advanced rendering capabilities, Isaac Sim requires a powerful NVIDIA RTX GPU. A **GeForce RTX 4070 Ti or higher** is strongly recommended for a smooth experience.

## 2. Universal Scene Description (USD)
Isaac Sim is built around Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD) format. USD is a powerful framework for describing, composing, and collaborating on 3D scenes. Think of it as the "HTML of 3D." All assets in Isaac Sim—robots, environments, and objects—are represented as USD files.
