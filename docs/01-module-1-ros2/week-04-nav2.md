# Week 4 - Navigation 2 & SLAM

## 1. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
SLAM is a technique used by robots to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of their own location within that map. This is a fundamental capability for autonomous mobile robots.

## 2. The Nav2 Stack
Nav2 is the official navigation stack in ROS 2. It's a powerful and flexible system that allows a robot to move from its current location to a desired goal location. It uses the map generated by a SLAM algorithm to plan a path and avoid obstacles.

## 3. Lab Assignment: Map a Room
For this week's lab, you will use the TurtleBot3 simulator to map a virtual room.

**Task:**
1.  Launch the TurtleBot3 Gazebo simulation.
2.  Launch the SLAM Toolbox node.
3.  Teleoperate the robot around the room to build a complete map.
4.  Save the map to a file.

This assignment will give you hands-on experience with a core robotics task and prepare you for the capstone project.
